## Weekly Meeting

### 2017/01/20

1. The project context part should be modified.

2. Resume and coverletter are required.

3. A detailed GT problem is discussed. Outlet boundary condition (conflict with the pump and the pressure boundary condition, set pump first and the pressure will be determined by the pump). Suggested to try some template of boundary conditions. Normally use pressure boundary condition for outlet flow.

4. Build the system on schematic, GT, complete circulate. Everybody try regardless the coolant properties etc.

5. GT trainning will give more details.

6. Questions about GT parallel and local solver.

7. Using the pressure drop to build more practical model and more temprature, materials can be added into the model later.

8. Thermal stud will not be open at some certain condition.

9. Some manuals are uploaded, relating to cooling system and engine heat distribution.

10. GT training the week after next week. Friday or Thursday.

11. Photoshooting. 3rd February.

12. Next week hope can split us into subgroups.Slides.

13. Trainning session is a place you ask questions, try more before you go to the meeting.

14. If you need more structure, ask them.

15. Polycom.

16. Use GT simulate the pump, radiator and thermal stat.
